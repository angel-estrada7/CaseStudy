   * I did reasearch on Paypal and learn intresting things about this compamy thats been around for quite some time.

* The founders consists of; Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Ken Howery, Yu Pan, Max Levchin, Luke Nosek
 > “a company founded on the premise of low-cost, almost effortless digital payments for consumers and businesses” 
 
* Peter Thiel and Max Levchin had in mind how businesses would handle money transfers as the internet grew more and more popular.

 >“PayPal makes money via transactions fees, premium features offered to business accounts (in the form of subscriptions), the sale of card readers, business loans, referral fees on cashback rewards, interchange fees, interest on cash, as well as by promoting shipment services” 

   * PayPal gets money from these forms and people usually want loans and are willing to pay more. In 2019 PayPal made an astonishing 17.7 Billion.
